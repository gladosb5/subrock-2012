## DO NOT ASK ME TO FIX BUGS, THIS IS ONLY A REUPLOAD! Also, this has the old logo, so this is prob older verison of SubRock


A fork [SubRocks](https://github.com/the-real-sumsome/subrocks-2012) You can visit the site at https://www.subrock.tk. (doesnt exist anymore)

## How to set up:

1. Get [phpMyAdmin](https://phpmyadmin.net) on your server.

2. Make a Database named "subrock"

3. Import the [SQL file](https://github.com/ralphuf/subrock-2012/blob/main/get-started/fulpedup.sql)
